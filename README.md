# New-York-City-taxi-fare-prediction
People of New York take hundreds of thousands of taxi rides per day. We are using the Kaggle competition “New York City Taxi Fare Prediction” dataset to make a Machine learning model that can predict the Taxi fare price. The approximate taxi fare prediction will help people of New York City to make their plans in advance and save money time. In recent years machine learning is very good and quite accurate about the predictions. In this research study, we are able to predict the fare of a taxi by building different models the help of applying different machine learning techniques such as AdaBoost, Classification and regression(CART), CatBoost, Deep neural networks, LightGBM.Root mean square error was the evaluation matrix for checking the accuracy of the models. Among them, LightGBM has given the best accuracy.
